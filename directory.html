         <p class="span11">The biggest obstacle most searchers encounter involves faulty investigation:</p>
         <h3 align="center" class="span11">Is the information any good?</h3>
         <h3 align="center" class="span11"><img src="images/check the fish.png" alt="investigate" width="143"/></h3>
         <p class="span11">There is a lot of bad information out there. Some of it is outdated; some of it is inaccurate; some is misleading. Without investigation, there's no way to tell good information from bad.</p>
         <p class="span11">It takes some effort to investigate online information. The reason most people fail to investigate isn't that it takes much time--they  simply forget to do it. The consequences of not checking information can be serious: lost money, lost trust, lost reputation. Not everything needs to be checked--but if you are risking your money and reputation on something you found online, the smart thing is to check the source (who wrote it), the content (its accuracy,  freshness, objectivity) and what experts think about it. </p>
