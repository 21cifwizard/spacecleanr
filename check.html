         <p class="span11">One of the five major skills most searchers fail to use involves investigation:</p>
         <h3 align="center" class="span11">How do I know the information is good?</h3>
         <h3 align="center" class="span11"><img src="images/check the fish.png" alt="check the information" width="100"/></h3>
         <p class="span11">Once you find information, it's up to you to determine if the information measures up. If you can't trust the information, don't use it. It should not be assumed that online information is credible or that it has been checked  by an expert. There are two areas for concentration: The <strong>Content</strong> and the <strong>Source</strong>. </p>
         <h3 align="center" class="span11">Investigate the Content</h3>
         <p class="span11" >Is the content accurate? Is it fresh? Is it objective? Investigative techniques include fact-checking and triangulation, date checking (meta-searching) and reading content to detect bias.</p>
         <h3 align="center" class="span11">Investigate the Source</h3>
         <p class="span11">What makes the author or publisher an expert? Who owns the information? Does the source shows evidence of bias? What do other authorities say about the content? Investigative techniques include fact-checking, searching specialized databases, using special operators, and analyzing content to detect bias and learn more about an author.</p>
